PhD Student, Researcher
======
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, Seattle focusing on \textbf{improving the \textit{accessibility, robustness}, and \textit{usability} of human-computer/-machine interfaces}. My research interest lies in the intersection of bioengineering and electrical \& computer engineering. My proposed Ph.D. research leverages theoretical techniques from control theory, game theory, and sensorimotor control to synthesize co-adaptive multimodal interfaces, and makes progress toward feasible and inclusive human-computer/-machine interfaces.
